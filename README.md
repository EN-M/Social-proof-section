Hi!

This is desktop-first like always. I guess desktop-firsts are easier for me.
I tried to make this more responsive for all screen sizes but I face some problems with really small screens. There is a "Section" element that is a child of the Body tag and if I give it padding all around in small screens(like iPhone 5 or galaxy fold in chrome developer tool) it doesn't apply(left and right padding). It's because of the size of the Section and other elements inside. I tried to fix it but couldn't, so I just let it be the way it was.
I learned few things in this project. One of the best things about this line of work is that you always learn something new.
